# Twitter Recorder Machine

The Twitter Recorder Machine, hereafter TRM, is a bunch of five dozen small python scripts that are used for various forensic tasks. 

This code is meant for use on a Linux host and you'll need the following in place to fully exercise it:

* one shell account per Twitter observer account
* tw-auth output goes in ~/.twitter
* system assumes ~/Dropbox is dedicated to TRM duty
* Twitter account needs secret trm-<name> list for each group to observer
