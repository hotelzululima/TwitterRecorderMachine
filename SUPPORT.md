# Gratis & Libre, Paid Support

Twitter Recorder Machine is free for academic users and in general the intent is to run it long term in a similar fashion to how Alien Vault offers both the OSSIM product and the Open Threat Exchange Service.

Maltego and Splunk are closed source but they are mature products that have made free access to experimenters a key component of their appeal. Unlike a certain predictive analytics vendor who shall remain nameless, they are probably not going to yank the rug out from under their installed base of gratis users. A classroom environment will ALWAYS be able to configure a sturdy base system that will facilitate teaching without spending anything other than time.

We envision that users in law enforcement and counter-terrorism will be interested in the feature set TRM offers. There are also likely use cases involving advocacy and elections. Right now there isn't anything to buy except some of our time and expertise. That might change at some point in the near future, but we expect that our revenue will be more focused on professional services and feed subscriptions rather than any sort of software licensing.

# Mailing List Support

If you need assistance there is a mailing list available. You can request to join by first making a connection with me on Linkedin.

The following are some topics you can expect to see covered:

<h1>Twitter Support</h1>
##Twitter Support
<h2>Twitter Support</h2>

The use of the system is fairly simple - put some accounts on a secret list, wait one minute per subject, and the system will auto-populate. There are a dozen little tricks of the trade for handling subjects that are attempting to evade surveillance or deceive observers. These things are also fodder for the mailing list.

# Social Network Analysis Support

The system produces files that are amenable to handling with the Gephi data visualization tool and the Maltego penetration tester toolkit will become an integral graphical frontend as the system matures. I am not really equipped to teach the basics of network analysis, but Coursera is. The University of Michigan SNA class by Lada Adamic will run again in October of 2014 and the Networks, Crowds and Markets book is an excellent read.

# Team Building & Analytical Methodology

There is a specific body of knowledge regarding what to expect when you get a group of grassroots users on this system. Much of the initial work with the system involved embeded users who were both collecting/analyzing and acting in an environment rife with deception. I don't think this applies to LE/COIN users, who would separate roles, but academic use cases may find this background of interest.

I have no formal behavioral psych training but I have a good working knowledge of common mental illnesses, character disorders, group dynamics involving individuals prone to conspiracy theories, and how these manifest among Twitter users.

My bookshelf includes Center for the Study of Inteligence classics like Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, On Thinking And Writing, I read all of the Kent Center Occasional Papers in 2013, and this will remain a growth direction for me. If any of my experience is of specific interest I am available for short term consulting opportunities, particularly if I get to learn some new area of tradecraft.

# Components




If we do this right there will be a body of users and collected wisdom. Both Maltego and Splunk provide frameworks for development, we'll arrange a way to make and keep this information available for all users.

There is some commercial software which would facilitate the growth of the system. I would like to acquire additional licenses for:

Maltego ($750)
Splunk Enterprise ($5,000)
R Studio ($1,000)
Sentinel Visualizer geospatial upgrade $(700?)
