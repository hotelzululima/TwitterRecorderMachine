# Gratis & Libre, Paid Support

Twitter Recorder Machine is free for academic users and in general the intent is to run it long term in a similar fashion to how Alien Vault offers both the OSSIM product and the Open Threat Exchange Service.

Maltego and Splunk are closed source but they are mature products that have made free access to experimenters a key component of their appeal. Unlike a certain predictive analytics vendor who shall remain nameless, they are probably not going to yank the rug out from under their installed base of gratis users. A classroom environment will ALWAYS be able to configure a sturdy base system that will facilitate teaching without spending anything other than time.

We envision that users in law enforcement and counter-terrorism will be interested in the feature set TRM offers. There are also likely use cases involving advocacy and elections. Right now there isn't anything to buy except some of our time and expertise. That might change at some point in the near future, but we expect that our revenue will be more focused on professional services and feed subscriptions rather than any sort of software licensing.

# Mailing List Support

If you need assistance there is a mailing list available. You can request to join by first making a connection with me on Linkedin.

The following are some topics you can expect to see covered:

####Twitter Software Support

The use of the system is fairly simple - put some accounts on a secret list, wait one minute per account, and the system will auto-populate. There are some API considerations that are not obvious until you are trying to observe thousands of accounts, there are some tricks you'll need to know if dealing with subjects that are evading surveillance or attempting deception. This is all good discussion fodder for the list.

####Server Support

There is a body of knowledge related to putting up a recorder, how to share it with people who don't need to know the DNS name or IP address of the system, what will and will not work with Tor, and so forth. Good practices with tcp wrappers, iptables, ssh keys, ssh port forwarding, and related topic are fair game.

# Social Network Analysis Support

The system produces files that are amenable to handling with the Gephi data visualization tool and the Maltego penetration tester toolkit will become an integral graphical frontend as the system matures. We are not really equipped to teach social network analysis, but Coursera is. The University of Michigan SNA class by Lada Adamic will run again in October of 2014 and the Networks, Crowds and Markets book is an excellent read.

# Team Building & Analytical Methodology

There is a specific body of knowledge regarding what to expect when you get a group of grassroots users on this system. Much of the initial work with the system involved embeded users who were both collecting/analyzing and acting in an environment rife with deception. We don't think this applies to LE/COIN users, who would separate those roles, but advocacy and elections would run into this. Continuity concerns in environments where collectors come, such as a rolling graduate level class accumulating knowledge on specific groups, is something we understand really well.

My bookshelf includes Center for the Study of Inteligence classics like Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, On Thinking And Writing, I read all of the Kent Center Occasional Papers in 2013, and this will remain a growth direction for me. We are good at the technology aspect of this problem, we could really use some relationships that enhance our analytical abilities.

The system itself directly supports a variety of analytical building blocks which are useful for reasoning about observed activities. These include:

#####network analysis of connections, mentions, favorites, Klout influencer/influencee
#####device usage analysis including visualization of large groups of users
#####temporal signature analysis with slicing by content source (ignore automation)
#####stylometry
